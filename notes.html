II slept when it rained yesterday

and today, my insomniac heart is bruised raw

with the blue of the morning.

I read the pages of November sky glistening 

like the purwai-kissed cheeks of the dark one.

With my desires catching cold, after being let out in the open,

I leave the debate of metaphysics to the bees.

The dream is too ravishing to open these eyes

but he, who wanders in the forests, 

tells me that dancing in the ruins of a dream

for too long slips poison in the gap 

between I and I-lessness.

Once again I gargle with warm salt water

and spit out one moon after another

to empty my throat of the heat that spread throughout 

after I drank the poison of eighty-four lakh lives 

without hearing the sweet notes of his flute.

O beloved of the cosmos!

Tell me how will this frail infinitude

survive the violence of its own loveliness?

I have a small voice

and can only talk of small things.

I may be a fool but I'm not dead.

I dare the hours to peel me

until I remain no more than a cry of anguish,

burning in the fever of this cyclic malady of lives and deaths.

The hiss of dreams boiling at the border

separating an oblivion from another

no longer scares me.

Bewildered by his games,

I repeatedly jump into the same dream,

shedding faces after faces.

That elusive trickster!

It's a clear November morning

but I hunger to dislodge the moon

behind his ear and brush dark from his knotted curls

before I'm tossed again

to suffer in the sea of forgetfulness and sleep.

Notes:

Purwai: The Indian name for easterly wind

Dark one: The name of Lord Krishna in Hinduism means the dark one

Lord Krishna is known to play flute in his adolescence

In Hinduism, it's believed that a soul gets birth as a human after living eighty four lives as microbes, insects, lizards, animals, birds etc.

Another name of Lord Krishna is Banke Bihari meaning the one who wanders in the forests

Lord Krishna is also known as Chhaliya or the trickster

Lord Krishna is believed to see the reflection of moon on its fourth day and as per Lord Ganesha's curse, anyone who sees moon on its fourth day, would have to suffer due to false allegations on him. Later, King Satrajit suspected him of killing Prasena, Satrajit's brother, in the greed of Syamantaka gem during hunting trip. Prasena was in fact killed by a lion, who mistaked the gem for fresh meat and took the precious jewel into a cave.
