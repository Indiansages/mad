II slept when it rained yesterday  <br>

and today, my insomniac heart is bruised raw  <br>

with the blue of the morning.  <br>

I read the pages of November sky glistening   <br>

like the purwai-kissed cheeks of the dark one.  <br>

With my desires catching cold, after being let out in the open,  <br>

I leave the debate of metaphysics to the bees.  <br>

The dream is too ravishing to open these eyes  <br>

but he, who wanders in the forests,   <br>

tells me that dancing in the ruins of a dream  <br>

for too long slips poison in the gap   <br>

between I and I-lessness.  <br>

Once again I gargle with warm salt water  <br>

and spit out one moon after another  <br>

to empty my throat of the heat that spread throughout   <br>
after I drank the poison of eighty-four lakh lives   <br>

without hearing the sweet notes of his flute.  <br>

O beloved of the cosmos!  <br>

Tell me how will this frail infinitude  <br>

survive the violence of its own loveliness?  <br>

I have a small voice

and can only talk of small things.

I may be a fool but I'm not dead.

I dare the hours to peel me

until I remain no more than a cry of anguish,

burning in the fever of this cyclic malady of lives and deaths.

The hiss of dreams boiling at the border

separating an oblivion from another

no longer scares me.

Bewildered by his games,

I repeatedly jump into the same dream,

shedding faces after faces.  <br>

That elusive trickster!  <br>

It's a clear November morning  <br>

but I hunger to dislodge the moon  <br>

behind his ear and brush dark from his knotted curls

before I'm tossed again  <br>

to suffer in the sea of forgetfulness and sleep.  <br>

.
