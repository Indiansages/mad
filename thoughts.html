        <div class="box">
           <ul> - i got lager from a friend of mine, had a can tonight, vile shit, but i took painkillers for a headache beforehand. if this ends up at the worst scenario, i'm sorry. </ul>

           <ul> - sometimes i sit there and just think how i got to this point. </ul>
        
           <ul> - i dunno man, im trying but just barely hanging on. </ul>
        
           <ul> - my arm is awful. i wouldnt be lying if i said i wasnt considering it right now. </ul>
        
           <ul> - maybe im not even ready for another, but i just dont feel loved in my current state. </ul>
        
           <ul> - i want to be in another relationship. i know people say "if you canâ€™t love yourself how the hell you gonna love somebody else?" but i dont feel like im deserving of love. just someone else.</ul>
        
           <ul> - so i lit my left wrist and hand on fire by accident. whoops. </ul>
        
          <ul>  - had a breakdown on twitter and just kept tweeting for an hour and a half. i hope that doesnt get me in trouble. i dont want to hurt anyone. just myself.</ul>
        
          <ul>  - i want to drive in the snow late at night listening to in rainbows. that sounds so melancholic. </ul>
        
          <ul>  - i have this urge when i get my new car to run away and never come back.. i want to just go start a new life somewhere where i wont have to worry about anything. </ul>

          <ul>  - having a 90s theme website makes me feel kind of cool. it would have been cool to have this in like 1997 or 1998. maybe then ppl would like me. </ul>
        
          <ul>  - sometimes i wonder. if my corpse was found like how i imagine it, would they finally care.once 1/3 of my skull is scattered on the floor, will they finally realize what happened.  </ul>
        
          <ul>  - thanks for 4k. </ul>
        
          <ul>  - theyre here. happiness here i fucking come. </ul>
        
          <ul>  - not sure how much more i can take of this. </ul>
